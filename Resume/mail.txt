Respected Sir / Madam,

My name is Gunalakshmanan M, and I am applying for the Python Developer position. I have hands-on experience through my internship as a Python Full Stack Developer, where I worked on Django, Flask, REST APIs, SQLite, SQL Server, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Bootstrap.

I have also developed AI-integrated applications using the OpenAI API, FAISS, and RAG-based systems, along with interactive visualizations using Three.js and GSAP. My experience in backend development, database handling, and building responsive user interfaces makes me a strong fit for this role.
